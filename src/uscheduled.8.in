.SH NAME
uscheduled - a job scheduler
.LINE
.section SYNOPSIS
\fBuscheduled\fR [-d DIR]
.section DESCRIPTION
\fBuscheduled\fR reads information about a number of jobs 
from \fIDIR\fR, or, if this is not given, from \fI~/.uschedule/\fR.
.paragraph
It then sleeps until one or more of the jobs have to be run, at which
point it will try to run and either reschedule or delete them.
.paragraph
\fBuscheduled\fR runs under the rights of the
user for whom the programs are started. It changes to \fIDIR\fR on
startup and runs in an own session. It doesn't detach from the
terminal or move itself into the background.
.paragraph
All time calculation is done in UTC.
.section "JOB EXECUTION"
If \fBuscheduled\fR needs to start a job the following will be 
done:
.list
.entry "uscheduled forks a new process."
.entry "the new process redirects /dev/null"
to file descriptors one and two, if desired.
.entry "the new process changes to $HOME."
.entry "the new process executes the program."
.entry "uscheduled reschedules the job.
.endlist
The users program will inherit the environment of the daemon, 
unless otherwise indicated during job creation time.
The standard input will be redirected from /dev/null. By default
the file descriptors one and two (standard and error output) are
not redirected, meaning that the output will go into the same
log files as the output of the daemon, if any.
.section "SIGNAL HANDLING"
\fBuscheduled\fR exits gracefully on SIGTERM. It reloads the job
specifications on SIGHUP.
