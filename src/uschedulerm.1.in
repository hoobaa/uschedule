.SH NAME
uschedulerm - remove uschedule jobs
.LINE
.section SYNOPSIS
\fBuschedulerm\fR [-.] [-d DIR] [-i] [-N] [-c] JOB-ID ...
.section DESCRIPTION
\fBuschedulerm\fR reads information about scheduled jobs 
from \fIDIR\fR, or, if this is not given, from \fI~/.uschedule/\fR.
The current working directory will be used instead of \fI~\fR if the 
\fI-.\fR or \fI--dot-as-home\fR option is given.
.paragraph
It then deletes all jobs with the identifier \fIJOB-ID\fR.
.paragraph
If the \fI-c\fR option is used then \fBuschedulerm\fB will not delete 
scheduled jobs but registered commands. In this mode no command with
more than one link is deleted, that is, commands referenced by any
active job cannot be removed.
.paragraph
To make \fIuschedulerm\fR ask before it removes any file use
the \fI-i\fR option. This option is the default is standard input
and output point to a terminal. If you don't want to be asked any
questions use the \fI-N\fR option.
