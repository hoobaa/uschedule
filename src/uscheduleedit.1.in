.SH NAME
uscheduleedit - edit a uschedule command
.LINE
.section SYNOPSIS
\fBuscheduleedit\fR [-.] [-d DIR] ID
.section DESCRIPTION
\fBuscheduleedit\fR allows you to edit the registered uschedule command with
the identifier \fIID\fR, using $VISUAL, $EDITOR or vi.
.paragraph
Note that a command may be described by two different files, so don't
be surprised if your editor offers you to edit two files.
.section OPTIONS
.options
.option "-., --dot-as-home"
The current working directory will be used instead of $HOME.
.option "-d, --dir=DIR"
Read jobs from \fIDIR\fR. The default is \fI~/.uschedule/\fR.
.section CAVEAT
If the editor of your choice breaks hard links then
\fBuschedulerm\fR will lose the ability to recognize which registered
commands are still in use. It will then not inform you a command you
want to delete about that and will not stop you from deleting it. The
daemon is able to deal with this, though.
