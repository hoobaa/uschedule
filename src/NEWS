Version 0.7.1, August 2004:

* fixed uschedulelist --short (-s), which used to display the "next" 
  instead of the "last" time.
* "uschedule --every X" (-e) repeats a job with a given interval X.
* The new uscheduleruntimelimit tool allows to limit the run time of a job.
* uscheduleconf makes base directory sticky for daemontools <0.75.
* uschedulelist --show-command (-S) shows the command in addition to the 
  usual list output.
* uschedule accepts + as synonym for / in TIMESPEC.

Version 0.7.0, March 2003:

* implemented -. option ("use . instead of $HOME").
* bugfix, "-" as username or logusername was mistreated.

  *** Impact: the user may have got root rights. ***

  Note: older versions may have left a multilog running as root instead
  of the user. Impact: the user may have got root rights.
  Fix: Go though /service/*uschedule*/log/run and add 
    setuidgid "username" \
  after the line containing the softlimit call and before the line 
  containing run. Afterwards the file should look like this:
    #! /bin/sh
    exec 2>&1
    cd '...SOMEWHERE...' || exit 1
    exec \
    softlimit -m 8000000 -o 400 -p 40 \
    setuidgid USERNAME \
    ./run

  The code containing the bug has been rewritten and simplified.

* uscheduleconf now has a --no-user-change option.

Version 0.6.1, October 2002:

Version 0.6.0, October 2002:
