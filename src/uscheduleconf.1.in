.SH NAME
uscheduleconf - configure a scheduling service
.LINE
.section SYNOPSIS
\fBuscheduleconf\fR DIR ACCT LOGACCT [JOBDIR [LOGDIR]]
.section DESCRIPTION
\fBuscheduleconf\fR creates a svscan service directory \fIDIR\fR, which
starts a service to uschedule for the user \fIACCT\fR. The jobs will be read
from \fIJOBDIR\fR (or ~\fIACCT\fR/.uschedule, if \fIJOBDIR\fR is not given
or only contains a minus character).
.paragraph
Logging information will be written to \fILOGDIR\fR 
(or ~\fIACCT\fR/.uschedule/log, if \fILOGDIR\fR is not given), using the
the account \fILOGACCT\fR.
.paragraph
Version before 0.7.0 allowed to give "-" for ACCT to use the current user
and "-" for LOGACCT to use ACCT for LOGACCT, but the code turned out to
be buggy. See the NEWS file of the uschedule package for more information.
.section "OPTIONS"
.options
.option "-n, --no-user-change"
Do not change file ownership and do not switch user ids.
.optionparagraph
The default is to make ACCT and LOGACCT the owners of JOBDIR, LOGDIR and
the file therein, and to switch to ACCT and LOGACCT before running 
uscheduled and the logging program.
.optionparagraph
With this option the caller will be the owner of all files created and 
the programs will run with all the rights they inherit.
.optionparagraph
This option was added in version 0.7.0.
.endoptions
.section "ENVIRONMENT"
In \fIJOBDIR\fR/env a number of environment variables are set (one file
per variable). HOME, SHELL, USER and LOGNAME are set to values taken 
from the system password database.
.br
The PATH variable is set to /command:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin/:/bin 
for any user not having an uid of 0. For users with uid 0 
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin will be appended. 
.paragraph
All these variables may be changed.
.paragraph
.section "SECURITY"
Keep the following rules in mind:
.list
.entry
Do not ever create a service directory \fIDIR\fR in an insecure place.
Nobody but you - the system administrator - must be able to write to it.
Especially do not ever create this directory in the users $HOME. You
would be giving away instant root access!
.entry
Do not ever create \fIJOBDIR\fR and \fILOGDIR\fR in an insecure place.
These directories and the content must only be writable by the user
for which the service is run.
.entry
Be careful about \fILOGACCT\fR. If you set up a scheduling service for
a user then \fILOGACCT\fR should be this user. If you are setting up
a scheduling service for a system account then you may want to use
a different user for logging purposes (while this is local policy i can't
think of any reason why the logging should run as root).
.entry
Resource limits may be configured in \fIDIR/run\fR and \fIDIR/log/run\fR.
The defaults are most possibly not right for every system. Keep in mind
that perl eats lots of resources and that a multilog processor may use
perl ...
.endlist
.section "EXAMPLES"
.subsection "Setup a scheduler for system services"
Create a uschedule service for root, with the service
directory /etc/root-schedule and the logging done to 
/var/log/root-schedule under the "misclog" account.
.paragraph
.nf
.HTML <pre>
    uscheduleconf /etc/root-schedule root misclog \\
             /etc/root-schedule/jobs /var/log/root-schedule
.HTML </pre>
.fi
.subsection "Setup a scheduler for a user"
Create a schedule service for uwe, having the trusted 
commands in /etc/uwe-schedule and any parts uwe can
change in ~uwe/.uschedule:
.paragraph
.nf
.HTML <pre>
    uscheduleconf /etc/uwe-schedule uwe uwe \\
             ~uwe/.uschedule ~uwe/.uschedule/logs
.HTML </pre>
