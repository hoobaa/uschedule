How to install uschedule
       This document describes how to download, compile, test and
       install uschedule.


   System requirements:
       The uschedule package is	 meant	to  run	 under	UNIX  and
       -lookalikes.

       You'll need the daemontools package by Daniel J. Bernstein
       to run uschedule, see http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html for
       a description and installation instructions.



   Downloading uschedule:
       The latest published uschedule package is:

       http://www.ohse.de/uwe/uschedule/uschedule-0.7.1.tar.gz

       You can alternatively download it through FTP:

       ftp://www.ohse.de/uwe/uschedule/uschedule-0.7.1.tar.gz

       Move the downloaded file to /package.


   Unpack the package:
	 # the next command is optional: If you do not use /package,
	 # you may unpack uschedule anywhere.
	 $ cd /package
	 $ gunzip uschedule-0.7.1.tar.gz
	 $ tar -xpf uschedule-0.7.1.tar
	 $ rm uschedule-0.7.1.tar
	 $ cd admin/uschedule-0.7.1


   Compile and install the programs, using /package:
	 $ package/install
       The  self  check	 is run as part of this and may take some
       time.   Things  are  fine  if  the  test	 does  not  print
       anything, but any output is a sign of a problem.



   Compile and install the programs under /usr/local:
	 $ make DEST=/usr/local oldinstall

       The  self  check	 is run as part of this and may take some
       time.   Things  are  fine  if  the  test	 does  not  print
       anything, but any output is a sign of a problem.
